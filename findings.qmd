## Land Cover Classification

![](Land%20Cover%20Classification%20-%202016%20vs%202020.png){fig-align="center"}

The results of the land cover classification of Punggol in 2016 and 2020 shows seven classes of land cover namely; water body, inland water, bare land, natural vegetation, managed vegetation, built-up and impervious surfaces.

### Area

![](change_in_area.jpg){fig-align="center"}

From 2016 to 2020, out of the seven classes identified, four of them saw an increase in area and they are Water body, Bare land, Natural vegetation and Built-up. In particular, Water body, Bare land and Built-up had a more-than-doubled increase in area of 93%, 143% and 86% respectively. The largest increase was for Bare land whose area increased from 1.11km^2^ to 2.70km^2^. On the other hand, land cover classes such as Inland water, Managed vegetation and Impervious surfaces all experienced a decrease, with Managed vegetation having the sharpest decline of 53%.

### Proportion

![](land_proportion.jpg)

Looking at the proportion of land cover classes, Managed vegetation and Built-up were the dominant land cover class in 2016, both with a proportion of 22%, while the least classified was Inland water with a percentage of 5%. However, in 2020, the percentage of Managed vegetation dropped drastically to 8% while Built-up increased to 32% and constituted the largest proportion of area. Similar to 2016, Inland water had the lowest proportion of area (2%). Other than Built-up which increased in proportion, land covers such as Water body and Bare land increased to 27% and 11% respectively. However, despite the increase in area for Natural vegetation from 3.11km^2^  to 3.47km^2^  from 2016 to 2020, the proportion of the land cover decreased from 16% to 14%. This is because the rate of increase in other land cover classes such as Water body, Bare land and Built-up exceeded the rate of increase in area for Natural vegetation.

### Land Cover Types

#### ![](districts.jpg)

#### Water body and Inland water

Land cover classes such as water body and inland water had some changes from 2016 to 2020. In particular, water body saw a huge increase in area from 3.5km^2^ in 2016 to 6.71km^2^ in 2020. Inland water, on the other hand, decreased from 0.90km^2^ to 0.48km^2^, and areas which were originally inland water in 2016 were classified as water body in 2020.

#### Bare land

In 2016, bare land only constituted 1.11km^2^ of area. Within a span of 4 years, the area increased to 2.70km^2^. Majority of the bare land will be reserved for future developments in Punggol such as new BTO projects as well as commercial developments.

#### Managed vegetation and Natural vegetation

For vegetation land cover, managed vegetation experienced a significant decline from 4.29km^2^ in 2016 to 2.01km^2^in 2020. Majority of the managed vegetation cover located at the Punggol Point District and Punggol Downtown area was deforested and became Bare land in 2020. Upon further research, it was found that HDB will have two BTO projects in Punggol Point, Punggol Point Crown and Punggol Point Cove that are estimated to be completed by 2024 and will provide at least 2,700 flats (Zheng, 2019). Additionally, the bare land in Punggol Downtown is likely to be used for built-up areas in the subsequent years for the development of commercial developments like the Punggol Digital District and Punggol Coast MRT, slated to open in 2023 and 2024 respectively (Wong, 2020). 

As for natural vegetation, there was a slight overall increase from 3.11km^2^ in 2016 to 3.47km^2^ in 2020, where areas at the Canal District were classified as natural vegetation in 2020. However, the increase in natural vegetation is negligible as compared to increase in other land cover classes. 

#### Built-up

Built-up areas also experienced a huge increase from 4.24km^2^ in 2016 to 7.88km^2^ in 2020 and is also the dominant land cover class for both years. Between 2016 to 2020, there were many new BTO projects introduced to meet the rising housing demands. These areas include Matilda District, Northshore District, and Waterway District, which consist of many new houses. An example is the Northshore Residences I and II, located in Punggol Northshore which were completed in 2020, offering around 1400 housing units. 

#### Impervious Surfaces

Lastly, the change in impervious surfaces from 2016 and 2020 is insignificant as the area of impervious surfaces constituted a very small amount of 2.40km^2^ in 2016 and 1.48km^2^ , making it difficult to observe the changes by looking at the map. 

### Accuracy Assessment

![](accuracy_assessment.jpg)\

#### User's Accuracy

The User's Accuracy measures the probability that a pixel labelled as a certain class is really in that class. In 2016, the user's accuracy ranged from 61% to 100%, with Impervious surfaces having the lowest user's accuracy and Bare land and Natural vegetation having the highest user's accuracy. In 2020, the user's accuracy ranged from 26% to 100%, with Inland water being the lowest and Bare land being the highest. The low user's accuracy of 26% for Inland water indicates a large number of False Positives, which means many of the pixels that were predicted to be inland water were not actually inland water.

#### Producer's Accuracy

The Producer's Accuracy measures the probability that a pixel in a given class was classified correctly. In 2016, the producer's accuracy ranged from 46% to 100%, with Built-up having the lowest producer's accuracy, and Water body, Inland water, Bare land, Managed vegetation having the highest. In 2020, the producer's accuracy ranged from 32% to 100%, with Built-up  being the lowest and Water body, Inland water and Natural vegetation being the highest. The low producer's accuracy for Built-up for both 2016 and 2020 indicates a large number of False Negatives, many pixels that were predicted to be in a different class belong to the built up class.

#### Overall Accuracy

The overall accuracy of a land cover classification refers to how effectively the pixels were grouped into the correct land cover class. The overall accuracy for 2016 and 2020 is 86% and 72% respectively. According to Anderson (1976), the minimum accuracy for land cover classification should be at least 85%. Based on the threshold, the overall accuracy for 2016 is at a relatively acceptable level of 86%, indicating that the majority of the pixels were correctly classified. However, the overall accuracy for 2020 is relatively lower at 72%, which is also below the threshold, indicating that there may be some discrepancies in the land cover classification results. 

#### **Kappa Statistic**

The Kappa Statistic provides an overall assessment of the accuracy of the classification by measuring how the classification results compare to values assigned by chance. The higher the value, the more accurate the classification is. The Kappa Statistic is 0.83 and 0.67 for 2016 and 2020 respectively, and based on the rating criteria, the strength of agreements lies in an almost perfect range for 2016 and a substantial range for 2020.

| Kappa Statistics | Strength of Agreement |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| \< 0.00          | Poor                  |
| 0.00 - 0.20      | Slight                |
| 0.21 - 0.40      | Fair                  |
| 0.41 - 0.60      | Moderate              |
| 0.61 - 0.80      | Substantial           |
| 0.81 - 1.00      | Almost perfect        |

#### F1 Score

The F1 score is a harmonic average of precision and recall and it is a measure of accuracy. The higher the score, the more accurate the classification model is.

Based on the results, the F1 score for 2016 and 2020 is 88% and 76% respectively. Although the F1 score for 2016 is relatively high, indicating that the classification is more accurate, the F1 score for 2020 is lower than ideal at 76%. Hence, further improvement needs to be done for 2020 in order to achieve a higher F1 score and a higher overall accuracy level.
