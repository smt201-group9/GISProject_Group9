The topic our group has chosen is Theme 1 Sub-theme 2: Land cover change detection using high resolution multi-spectral satellite data.\n\nSingapore's urbanization has progressed rapidly due to rising demand for public housing. This increasing demand for housing estates, especially for Build-To-Order (BTO) flats puts greater pressure on HDB to ramp up the supply of flats to meet the increasing housing needs.\nWith more land reserved for residential purposes, biodiversity loss and pressures on natural ecosystems are becoming more pertinent, especially with increasing land cover change due to changing land uses. Punggol being Singapore‚Äôs first eco-town, we are interested in what is the extent to which recent urban developments in Punggol have changed its land cover, starting from the opening of Waterway Point in 2016, to implementations of smart initiatives for Northshore District in 2020.\nIn this project, we analysed the land cover changes and impact on Punggol from 2016 to 2020 through the use of remote sensing data, satellite imagery and image processing techniques.\nUsing Sentinel-2 satellite imagery data, we created True and False Color Composites of the map. By defining seven land cover classes; namely Water body, Inland water, Bare land, Natural vegetation, Managed vegetation, Built-up and Impervious surfaces, we digitised the training and testing samples to perform Supervised Classification. Lastly, we performed the land cover change detection using the Semi-automatic classification Plugin (SCP) to identify changes in vegetation.\nFrom 2016 to 2020, Managed vegetation had the highest decrease in land cover, while Water body, Bare land and Built-up increased significantly. The results of the land cover classification showed a high overall accuracy of 86% and Kappa Statistic of 0.88 for 2016, and an overall accuracy of 72% and Kappa Statistic of 0.67 for 2020.¬†\n=Based on the Land Cover Change analysis of Punggol, we discovered several land cover changes from 2016 to 2020. For water, there was only a slight change from 4.89km2¬† in 2016 to 4.78km2 in 2020. Vegetation, on the other hand saw moderate level of changes from¬† 6.53km2 in 2016 to 5.63km2 in 2020, where majority of vegetation was converted to bare land and built-up areas which were primarily used for the developments of BTO projects and upcoming developments such as Punggol Digital District.

    "text": "Over the past few decades, Singapore has witnessed the rapid progression of urbanization due to rising demand for public housing. In 2020, the demand for Build-To-Order (BTO) flats jumped by 70% as compared to previous years due to many of the younger generation‚Äôs desire to start a family (Sun, 2021). In response to this, HDB will be increasing their supply of new flats over the next few years to meet the high housing demand (HDB, 2021). Now that more land will be reserved for residential purposes, the loss of biodiversity and pressures on ecosystem services are becoming more pertinent especially with increasing land cover change due to changing land uses.¬†\nLand use and land cover change detection are an important source of information for decision making. Land cover shows areas that are covered by forests, wetland, impervious surfaces, agriculture and other land and water types. Land cover change can be determined by analyzing satellite imagery and is crucial in making informed policy, development and planning decisions. In contrast, land use refers to how people utililse the land for various purposes like recreation, development and more (Natural Resources Canada, 2015).\nIn this project, we utilised remote sensing data, satellite imagery and image processing techniques to study the change in land cover detection of our selected area of interest, Punggol for years 2016 and 2020."

In specificity, Northshore District's smart and sustainable precincts have been recently spearheaded by URA and HDB through smart planning ever since their first success in promoting sustainable green living through Treelodge@Punggol (Eastern Loop) (HDB, n.d.).\nWith Punggol being the up-and-coming estate in Singapore, there are many future development plans that may impact the land cover use in that area. An example is the Punggol Digital District scheduled to open in 2023, which is known as the \"smart-district\" that brings together industry and academia through collaboration of work spaces and facilities (URA,n.d.). Another promising development is the Punggol Coast MRT which will bring more convenience to the residents of Punggol, reducing the travel time between Punggol and Pasir Ris from 45 minutes to just 20 minutes (Hao, 2021). These commercial and transportation infrastructure may result in alterations in land cover use so that more space is available for such developments.\nAs such, it would be interesting to dive deeper to analyse the changes in land cover to meet the increasing demand and the impact it has on Punggol as Singapore's first eco-town.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: Stacked Homes"

However, Sentinel-2 data is only available from June 2015 onwards, which means it is unable to detect earlier change prior to June 2015. Hence, 2016 and 2020 satellite images will be used in our analysis.\nThe Sentinel-2 satellites each carry a single multi-spectral instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral channels in the visible/near infrared (VNIR) and short wave infrared spectral range (SWIR).\nThe table below provides more details about the 13 spectral bands.\n\nSource: Satellite Imaging Corporation\n\nUsing satellite imagery allows us to study Land Cover change because the images cover large geographical areas and have high temporal coverage. The different sensors with images of varying resolutions can help to detect specific land types.\n\nWhile it is an effective tool to study Land Use and Land Cover Change, many sensors are unable to obtain data and information through cloud cover. Hence, it is important to choose a selected area that is free of cloud cover, otherwise a cloud mask has to be used.\n\nProject Study Area\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selected area of interest is Punggol which is located in the northeastern region of Singapore. The reason for choosing Punggol is because it is one of the few areas that were free of cloud cover. It is strongly recommended to select areas free of cloud as cloud cover would make extracting information more difficult, and a cloud mask would have to be used for cloud removal. Punggol has undergone rapid development and changes over the years, and with many future developments such as the Punggol Digital District and residential developments coming up, it would be interesting to find out the changes in land cover and use to meet rising residential demands."

    "section": "Land Cover Classification",
    "text": "Land Cover Classification\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the land cover classification of Punggol in 2016 and 2020 shows seven classes of land cover namely; water body, inland water, bare land, natural vegetation, managed vegetation, built-up and impervious surfaces.\n\nArea\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom 2016 to 2020, out of the seven classes identified, four of them saw an increase in area and they are Water body, Bare land, Natural vegetation and Built-up. In particular, Water body, Bare land and Built-up had a more-than-doubled increase in area of 93%, 143% and 86% respectively. The largest increase was for Bare land whose area increased from 1.11km2 to 2.70km2. On the other hand, land cover classes such as Inland water, Managed vegetation and Impervious surfaces all experienced a decrease, with Managed vegetation having the sharpest decline of 53%.\n\n\nProportion\n\nLooking at the proportion of land cover classes, Managed vegetation and Built-up were the dominant land cover class in 2016, both with a proportion of 22%, while the least classified was Inland water with a percentage of 5%. However, in 2020, the percentage of Managed vegetation dropped drastically to 8% while Built-up increased to 32% and constituted the largest proportion of area. Similar to 2016, Inland water had the lowest proportion of area (2%). Other than Built-up which increased in proportion, land covers such as Water body and Bare land increased to 27% and 11% respectively. However, despite the increase in area for Natural vegetation from 3.11km2 ¬†to 3.47km2¬† from 2016 to 2020, the proportion of the land cover decreased from 16% to 14%. This is because the increase in other land cover classes such as Water body, Bare land and Built-up was significantly higher than the increase in area for Natural vegetation, making the increase in that particular land cover insignificant.¬†\n\n\nLand Cover Types\n\n\n\n\nWater body and Inland water\nLand cover classes such as water body and inland water had some changes from 2016 to 2020. In particular, water body saw a huge increase in area from 3.5km2 in 2016 to 6.71km2 in 2020. Inland water, on the other hand, decreased from 0.90km2 to 0.48km2, and areas which were originally inland water in 2016 were classified as water body in 2020.\n\n\nBare land\nIn 2016, bare land only constituted 1.11km2 of area. Within a span of 4 years, the area increased to 2.70km2. Majority of the bare land will be reserved for future developments in Punggol such as new BTO projects as well as commercial developments.\n\n\nManaged vegetation and Natural vegetation\nFor vegetation land cover, managed vegetation experienced a significant decline from 4.29km2 in 2016 to 2.01km2in 2020. Majority of the managed vegetation cover located at the Punggol Point District and Punggol Downtown area was deforested and became Bare land in 2020. Upon further research, it was found that HDB will have two BTO projects in Punggol Point, Punggol Point Crown and Punggol Point Cove that are estimated to be completed by 2024 and will provide at least 2,700 flats (Zheng, 2019). Additionally, the bare land in Punggol Downtown is likely to be used for built-up areas in the subsequent years for the development of commercial developments like the Punggol Digital District and Punggol Coast MRT, slated to open in 2023 and 2024 respectively (Wong, 2020).¬†\nAs for natural vegetation, there was a slight overall increase from 3.11km2 in 2016 to 3.47km2 in 2020, where areas at the Canal District were classified as natural vegetation in 2020. However, the increase in natural vegetation is negligible as compared to increase in other land cover classes.¬†\n\n\nBuilt-up\nBuilt-up areas also experienced a huge increase from 4.24km2 in 2016 to 7.88km2 in 2020 and is also the dominant land cover class for both years. Between 2016 to 2020, there were many new BTO projects introduced to meet the rising housing demands. These areas include Matilda District, Northshore District, and Waterway District, which consist of many new houses. An example is the Northshore Residences I and II, located in Punggol Northshore which were completed in 2020, offering around 1400 housing units.¬†\n\n\nImpervious Surfaces\nLastly, the change in impervious surfaces from 2016 and 2020 is insignificant as the area of impervious surfaces constituted a very small amount of 2.40km2 in 2016 and 1.48km2 , making it difficult to observe the changes by looking at the map.¬†\n\n\n\nAccuracy Assessment\n\n\n\nUser‚Äôs Accuracy\nThe User's Accuracy measures the probability that a pixel labelled as a certain class is really in that class. In 2016, the user's accuracy ranged from 61% to 100%, with Impervious surfaces having the lowest user's accuracy and Bare land and Natural vegetation having the highest user's accuracy. In 2020, the user's accuracy ranged from 26% to 100%, with Inland water being the lowest and Bare land being the highest. The low user's accuracy of 26% for Inland water indicates a large number of False Positives, which means many of the pixels that were predicted to be inland water were not actually inland water.\n\n\nProducer‚Äôs Accuracy\nThe Producer's Accuracy measures the probability that a pixel in a given class was classified correctly. In 2016, the producer's accuracy ranged from 46% to 100%, with Built-up having the lowest producer's accuracy, and Water body, Inland water, Bare land, Managed vegetation having the highest. In 2020, the producer's accuracy ranged from 32% to 100%, with Built-up ¬†being the lowest and Water body, Inland water and Natural vegetation being the highest. The low producer's accuracy for Built-up for both 2016 and 2020 indicates a large number of False Negatives, many pixels that were predicted to be in a different class belong to the built up class.\n\n\nOverall Accuracy\nThe overall accuracy of a land cover classification refers to how effectively the pixels were grouped into the correct land cover class. The overall accuracy for 2016 and 2020 is 86% and 72% respectively. According to Anderson (1976), the minimum accuracy for land cover classification should be at least 85%. Based on the threshold, the overall accuracy for 2016 is at a relatively acceptable level of 86%, indicating that the majority of the pixels were correctly classified. However, the overall accuracy for 2020 is relatively lower at 72%, which is also below the threshold, indicating that there may be some discrepancies in the land cover classification results.¬†\n\n\nKappa Statistic\nThe Kappa Statistic provides an overall assessment of the accuracy of the classification by measuring how the classification results compare to values assigned by chance. The higher the value, the more accurate the classification is. The Kappa Statistic is 0.83 and 0.67 for 2016 and 2020 respectively, and based on the rating criteria, the strength of agreements lies in an almost perfect range for 2016 and a substantial range for 2020.\n\n\n\nKappa Statistics\nStrength of Agreement\n\n\n\n\n< 0.00\nPoor\n\n\n0.00 - 0.20\nSlight\n\n\n0.21 - 0.40\nFair\n\n\n0.41 - 0.60\nModerate\n\n\n0.61 - 0.80\nSubstantial\n\n\n0.81 - 1.00\nAlmost perfect\n\n\n\n\n\nF1 Score\nThe F1 score is a harmonic average of precision and recall and it is a measure of accuracy. The higher the score, the more accurate the classification model is.\nBased on the results, the F1 score for 2016 and 2020 is 88% and 76% respectively. Although the F1 score for 2016 is relatively high, indicating that the classification is more accurate, the F1 score for 2020 is lower than ideal at 76%. Hence, further improvement needs to be done for 2020 in order to achieve a higher F1 score and a higher overall accuracy level."
